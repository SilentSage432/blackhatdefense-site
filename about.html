      <h1>About Black Hat Defense LLC</h1>

      <p>
        Black Hat Defense LLC is a cybersecurity consulting firm focused on
        authorized offensive security, adversarial testing, and risk validation.
        Our work helps organizations understand how real-world attackers identify
        weaknesses and achieve impact—so those risks can be addressed before they
        are exploited.

      <p>
        Our mission is to help organizations make informed security decisions by

      <p>
        We believe effective security comes from understanding actual risk rather
