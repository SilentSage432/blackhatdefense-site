    <h1>About Black Hat Defense LLC</h1>

    <p>
      Black Hat Defense LLC is a cybersecurity consulting firm focused on ethical
      offensive security, adversarial risk assessment, and OSINT-driven exposure
      analysis. Our work is centered on helping organizations understand how they
      can actually be compromised—and what to do about it—before real attackers
      take advantage of those weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      We combine technical testing with intelligence-driven analysis to identify
      meaningful risk across applications, networks, infrastructure, and publicly
      exposed assets. All work is performed under controlled, authorized
      conditions and aligned to client objectives.

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Effective security starts with realism, not assumptions. Many organizations
      focus inward while attackers begin externally—using publicly available
      information, misconfigurations, and unintended exposure to gain access or
      influence outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach emphasizes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Realistic testing aligned to real-world threat models</li>
      <li>OSINT-driven visibility into external exposure and attack surface</li>
      <li>Clear communication of risk and impact</li>
      <li>Actionable remediation guidance, not noise</li>
      <li>Respect for operational constraints and business priorities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is not volume or theatrics, but decision-quality insight.

    <h2>OSINT & Intelligence-Driven Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      Open-source intelligence (OSINT) plays a critical role in how modern attacks
      begin. We use OSINT techniques to identify publicly accessible information,
      assets, and exposure that may be leveraged as part of a broader attack path.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes analysis of:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Internet-facing systems and services</li>
      <li>Unintended data exposure and metadata</li>
      <li>Credential leaks and third-party platform exposure</li>
      <li>Organizational footprint across public sources</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      OSINT is used to inform testing scope, improve realism, and help clients
      reduce unnecessary visibility and external risk.

    <h2>Ethical and Authorized Testing</h2>

    <p>
      All work performed by Black Hat Defense LLC is conducted under explicit
      written authorization and within clearly defined legal and ethical
      boundaries. We do not engage in unauthorized testing, surveillance, or
      exploit development for malicious use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professionalism, discretion, and client trust are fundamental to how we
      operate.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Experience and Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Our experience spans modern IT environments, network infrastructure,
      industrial systems, and externally exposed organizational assets.
      Engagements are tailored to the client’s environment, risk tolerance, and
      operational realities.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure testing is effective,
      minimally disruptive, and produces results that can be acted on.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Work With</h2>

    <p>
      We work with organizations that want a clear understanding of their real
      exposure, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Small and mid-sized businesses</li>
      <li>Industrial and manufacturing environments</li>
      <li>Organizations operating critical or high-availability systems</li>
      <li>Teams preparing for audits, compliance reviews, or internal risk assessments</li>
    </ul>
