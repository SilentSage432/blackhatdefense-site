    <h1>About Black Hat Defense LLC</h1>

    <p>
      Black Hat Defense LLC is a cybersecurity consulting firm focused on
      authorized offensive security, adversarial testing, and risk validation.
      Our work helps organizations understand how real-world attackers identify
      weaknesses and achieve impact—so those risks can be addressed before they
      are exploited.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>
      Our mission is to help organizations make informed security decisions by
      providing realistic, responsible, and actionable security assessments.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe effective security comes from understanding actual risk rather
      than relying solely on theoretical models or compliance checklists.
