    <h2>Why Offensive Security</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional security controls often fail silently. Offensive security
      testing validates whether defenses work under realistic conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings are translated into business-relevant risk context for decision-makers.

    <h2>Professional & Authorized Engagements</h2>
    <p>
      All work is conducted with explicit authorization, defined scope, and
      documented objectives. No gray areas. No bullshit.
