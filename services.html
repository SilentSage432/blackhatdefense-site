    <h2>Penetration Testing</h2>

    <p>
      Penetration testing evaluates the security of systems, applications, and
      networks by simulating realistic attack scenarios under controlled
      conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to identify exploitable weaknesses, assess potential impact,
      and provide clear, actionable remediation guidance.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>External and internal network testing</li>
      <li>Web application security testing</li>
      <li>Authenticated and unauthenticated assessments</li>
      <li>Clear reporting with prioritized findings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adversarial Security Testing</h2>

    <p>
      Adversarial security testing goes beyond checklist-based assessments by
      focusing on how real attackers think, chain weaknesses, and achieve
      objectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      These engagements are designed to test detection, response, and overall
      resilience rather than individual controls in isolation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Threat-informed attack simulation</li>
      <li>Control validation and gap analysis</li>
      <li>Detection and response evaluation</li>
      <li>Executive-level risk context</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>ICS / SCADA Security Assessments</h2>

    <p>
      Industrial control systems require a specialized approach that balances
      security testing with safety, availability, and operational constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assessments focus on identifying exposure, misconfigurations, and attack
      paths without disrupting critical processes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>ICS and SCADA architecture review</li>
      <li>Network segmentation and exposure analysis</li>
      <li>Protocol and device risk assessment</li>
      <li>Operationally safe testing methodologies</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>OSINT & Attack Surface Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      Open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis identifies publicly available
      information that may expose organizations to social engineering,
      reconnaissance, or targeted attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This service helps organizations understand what an external adversary can
      learn without any direct access.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>External asset discovery</li>
      <li>Public exposure and data leakage identification</li>
      <li>Brand and infrastructure reconnaissance</li>
      <li>Risk-focused reporting</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Engagement Model</h2>

    <p>
      All services are delivered under a formal agreement that defines scope,
      authorization, objectives, and reporting requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Black Hat Defense LLC reserves the right to decline engagements that fall
      outside legal, ethical, or professional boundaries.
